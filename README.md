## Emeal-Server

This is the server for the iOS app [Emeal](https://github.com/kiliankoe/emeal). It's powered by Ruby and Sinatra.

More infos will be added shortly as this is currently being built :grin:

### Roadmap (items  in no particular order)

 - [ ] Scrape the mensa pages and offer content via a JSON API
 - [ ] Provide filter options based on a number of criteria (mensa, date, ingredients, price, etc?)
 - [ ] Package the scraper into its own gem
 - [ ] Cache scraped contents and pull from local DB for increased speed and lower load on the official page
 - [ ] (maybe) store ratings and additional images
 - [ ] (maybe) offer *historic* data
